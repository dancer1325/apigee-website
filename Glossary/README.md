# API Proxies
- 👀 := Foundation of building out your API 👀
     - == interfaces for your backend services / abstract them
         - abstract == if you make changes in the backend services → APIs are still invoked
- == way to expose APIs on Apigee
- ⚠️ give the full power of Apigee’s API platform ⚠️
     - secure API calls
     - throttle traffic
         - rate limit & quotas
     - mediate messages
     - control error handling
     - cache things
     - build developer portals
     - document APIs
     - analyze API traffic data
     - earn money — with the use of your APIs —
     - protect agains bots
     - [modernize SOAP services](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Apigee/Apigee-X-Support-for-SOAP-Webservices/m-p/419451#M70359)
- types of endpoints
     - proxyEndpoint
         - == way / client apps — consume — APIs
             - API proxy URL
             **Note:** → HTTP or HTTPS
             - policies
                 - security
                 - quota checks
                 - rate limits
     - targetEndpoint
         - == way API proxy — interacts with — backend service
             - security settings
             - policies
                 - check response’s message format
- types of proxies
    - standard
        - := proxy / includes ONLY Standard policies
        - uses
            - lightweight API solutions
            - NOT included in API products
    - extensible
        - := proxies / includes ≥ 1 Extensible policies or flow hook
            - → can include more functionality
